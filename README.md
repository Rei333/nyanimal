# How to play ?
After installing the website and creating the .env.php file (using the template), you have to create an account with a pseudo, a password and include your e-mail.

On that code’s version, the only feature that is implemented is the one used to buy furniture. You can buy or replace your actual furniture if needed/wanted (you can only have one piece of furniture per category).
